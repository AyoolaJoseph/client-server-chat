# client-server-chat

A straightforward chat application has been developed utilizing Java and Swing for the graphical user interface. This application employs sockets for communication purposes. It is structured around a client-server model, where both the client and server are capable of exchanging messages with each other. In this setup, users interact through a designated username, which identifies them during the messaging process.

The server plays a critical role in this architecture, as it is responsible for establishing the foundational parameters of the communication, specifically the IP address and the port number. These details are essential for the client, as they must be accurately specified to ensure a successful connection to the intended server. Once this connection has been established, the pathway for communication is open, allowing for the seamless exchange of messages between the client and server.

This model not only facilitates direct communication but also lays the groundwork for a potentially scalable messaging system, where enhancements and additional features can be integrated to enrich the user experience.
